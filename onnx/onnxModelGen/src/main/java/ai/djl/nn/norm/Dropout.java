/**
 * A dropout layer benefits a network by allowing some units (neurons), and hence their respective
 * connections, of a network to be randomly and temporarily removed by setting its value to 0
 * <b>only</b> during training by specified probability \(p\), usually set to 0.5. The use of
 * dropout acts as if multiple networks with different architectures had been trained, and during
 * test/inference, the removed unit's output is multiplied by \(p\) as an approximation of the
 * averaged output of all the possible network architectures for that unit. The implementation of
 * dropout gives state-of-the-art performances for diverse tasks as shown in the proposal's <a
 * href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf">paper</a>, suggesting its
 * general-use capability.
 *
 * <p>The idea of dropout itself was proposed in 2014, with the purpose of improving the performance
 * of large networks due to co-adaptation, where some connections are stronger and learned more
 * while other connections become weaker and loses their impact on the prediction, resulting in
 * network overfitting. It was also created as an alternative for costly networks, such as large or
 * ensemble networks, by removing several units, hence creating different thinned network
 * architectures and simulates multiple networks within a single network, greatly reducing the
 * computation cost.
 *
 * <p>Dropout is recommended to be used when one is trying to optimize an overfitting network or
 * when large dataset is available. It is still quite commonly used in many publications due to its
 * generalization capability. However, using dropout may not prevent overfitting due to variation
 * and limited size of the dataset, and it is reported that dropout layer increases training time by
 * 2-3 times since different simulated multiple networks are trained for each iteration, thus
 * resulting in noisy parameter updates.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://d2l.djl.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/dropout.html">The D2L chapter on
 *     dropout</a>
