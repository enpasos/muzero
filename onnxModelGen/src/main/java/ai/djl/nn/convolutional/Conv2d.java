/**
 * Being the pioneer of convolution layers, {@code Conv2d} layer works on two dimensions of input,
 * {@link LayoutType#WIDTH} and {@link LayoutType#HEIGHT} as usually a {@code Conv2d} layer is used
 * to process data with two spatial dimensions, namely image. The concept itself works just as how
 * {@link Convolution} does, and each filter slides through an input data by two directions, first
 * traversing the {@link LayoutType#WIDTH} then traverses each row of the data.
 *
 * <p>First proposed by LeCun <i>et al.</i>'s <a
 * href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf">paper</a>, 2-dimensional convolution
 * layer gained its rising interest with the publication of <a
 * href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">
 * paper</a> about AlexNet for image classification task. It is still commonly used in image-related
 * tasks and adapted in other tasks, including but not limited to 1-dimensional data which may be
 * transformed to 2-dimensional data, though {@link Conv1d} is now available for use.
 *
 * <p>The input to a {@code Conv2d} is an {@link ai.djl.ndarray.NDList} with a single 4-D {@link
 * ai.djl.ndarray.NDArray}. The layout of the {@link ai.djl.ndarray.NDArray} must be "NCHW". The
 * shapes are
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code data: (batch_size, channel, height, width)}
 *   <li>{@code weight: (num_filter, channel, kernel[0], kernel[1])}
 *   <li>{@code bias: (num_filter,)}
 *   <li>{@code out: (batch_size, num_filter, out_height, out_width)} <br>
 *       {@code out_height = f(height, kernel[0], pad[0], stride[0], dilate[0])} <br>
 *       {@code out_width = f(width, kernel[1], pad[1], stride[1], dilate[1])} <br>
 *       {@code where f(x, k, p, s, d) = floor((x + 2 * p - d * (k - 1) - 1)/s) + 1}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both {@code weight} and {@code bias} are learn-able parameters.
